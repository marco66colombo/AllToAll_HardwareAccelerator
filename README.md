## Abstract
Many scientific applications, including the computation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FTT),
require an all to all operation. Performing this operation with a general-purpose processor can be
very costly since the memory hierarchy used in such processors is not optimal for the intensive
exchange of data required by the all to all. However, this operation can be sped up by using a
customized hardware accelerator specifically designed for this task. In this project, we present
an implementation of such an accelerator, that implements a broadcast algorithm that further
explores the parallelism in message transmission. Finally, we have validated the accelerator through
RTL software simulation and compared the obtained performance with respect to the available
bandwidth.
